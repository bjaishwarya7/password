# 🔐 Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this task is to understand what makes a password strong, create multiple example passwords with varying complexity, and evaluate their strength using online password strength checkers.

## 🛠 Tools Used

* **Password Strength Checker:** [Password Meter](https://kaspersky.com)
* **Other References:** Cybersecurity best practices, online research on password attacks

## 📄 Steps Followed

1. **Created Multiple Passwords**

   * Designed passwords with different complexity levels:

     * Short simple passwords
     * Medium complexity passwords
     * Highly complex passwords with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols

2. **Tested Password Strength**

   * Entered each password into the strength checker
   * Recorded scores and feedback

3. **Analyzed Results**

   * Compared weak, medium, and strong passwords
   * Identified key factors that increase strength

4. **Researched Password Attacks**

   * Brute force attacks
   * Dictionary attacks
   * Social engineering risks

5. **Noted Best Practices**

   * Password length ≥ 12 characters
   * Mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
   * Avoid dictionary words and personal info
   * Use passphrases for memorability
   * Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)

## 📊 Results

| Password Example | Score (%) | Strength Level | Notes from Tool                        |
| ---------------- | --------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `hello123`       | 28%       | Weak           | Too short, predictable                 |
| `Myp@ssw0rd!`    | 65%       | Medium         | Contains variety but still predictable |
| `H&3r#7tL!9q@P`  | 98%       | Very Strong    | Long, complex, random                  |

## 📚 Key Learnings

* **Length matters:** Each additional character exponentially increases crack time.
* **Complexity helps:** Use a mix of symbols, numbers, uppercase, and lowercase.
* **Avoid patterns:** Predictable sequences reduce security.
* **Use MFA:** Adds an extra layer of defense beyond passwords.
* **Password managers:** Safely store and generate secure passwords.
